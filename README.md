# Nearest Postals

This script displays the nearest postal next to map, and allows you to navigate to specific postal codes with `/postal`
I used [Oulsen_satmap](https://github.com/Oulsen/oulsen_satmap) for the High Resolution map and [DevBlocky's Nearest-Postal V1.5.3](https://github.com/DevBlocky/nearest-postal) for the FiveM resource.

## Installation

1. Copy the Nearest-Postal resource into your resources folder.
